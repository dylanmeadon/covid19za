## Notebooks for analysis and modelling
This folder contains notebooks for analysis and modelling of the COVID-19 data. Some use the data in the repo, some fetch data from external data.

## Where do I start?
### Running the notebooks
You can pull the repo and then run the notebooks and make adjustments as I need. 

### Getting ideas
See the great resource from fastai on different analysis and modelling notebooks. [URL](https://covid19dashboards.com/)

### TODO
Have simple link to mybinder for all notebooks
